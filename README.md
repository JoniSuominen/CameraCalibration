# Colour Correction using Splines

This repository contains the evaluation code for the paper "Color Correction using Splines" presented at Electronic Imaging 2024.

## File Structure

[spline_tuning.ipynb](spline_tuning.ipynb) contains the Jupyter Notebook for finding appropriate smoothing parameters for the spline models.

[model_evaluation.ipynb](model_evaluation.ipynb) contains the actual evaluation script for linear, root-polynomial, polynomial and spline models.
